msgid "Note that this is all about the title tag. This is what you see in your browser's window title bar. This is NOT visible on a page, only in the window title bar and of course in the source. If set, all page, post, category, search and archive page titles get rewritten. You can specify the format for most of them. For example: The default templates puts the title tag of posts like this: \"Blog Archive >> Blog Name >> Post Title\" (maybe I've overdone slightly). This is far from optimal. With the default post title format, Rewrite Title rewrites this to \"Post Title | Blog Name\". If you have manually defined a title (in one of the text fields for All in One SEO Plugin input) this will become the title of your post in the format string."
