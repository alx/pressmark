=== OpenID ===
Contributors: wnorris, factoryjoe
Tags: openid, authentication
Requires at least: 2.2
Tested up to: 2.6.2
Stable tag: 3.0

Allows WordPress to provide and consumer OpenIDs for authentication of users and comments.

== Description ==

**Upgrade Notes:** If you are upgrading to version 3.0 from a previous version,
it is extremely important that you backup your blog before doing so.  This
release includes database changes that, though they have been thoroughly
tested, may cause problems.  You will also need to deactivate and reactivate
the plugin after upgrading.

OpenID is an [open standard][] that allows users to authenticate to websites
without having to create a new password.  This plugin allows users to login to
their local WordPress account using an OpenID, as well as enabling commenters
to leave authenticated comments with OpenID.  Version 3.0 includes an OpenID
provider as well, enabling users to login to OpenID-enabled sites using their
own personal WordPress account. [XRDS-Simple][] is required for the OpenID
Provider.

Developer documention, which includes all of the public methods and hooks for
integrating with and extending the plugin, can be found [here][dev-doc].

1. Configure the plugin through the 'OpenID' section of the 'Options' menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I get blank screens when I activate the plugin? =

In some cases the plugin may have problems if not enough memory has been
allocated to PHP.  Try ensuring that the PHP memory_limit is at least 8MB
(limits of 64MB are not uncommon).

= Why don't `https` OpenIDs work? =

SSL certificate problems creep up when working with some OpenID providers
(namely MyOpenID).  This is typically due to an outdated CA cert bundle being
used by libcurl.  An explanation of the problem and a couple of solutions 
can be found [here][libcurl].

= How do I add an OpenID field to my comment form? =

The easiest way to display the fact that your blog accepts OpenIDs is to enable
the "Comment Form" option for the plugin.  This will allow the normal website
field to be used for OpenIDs as well.  If this doesn't display properly for
your particular theme or you simply prefer to have a separate OpenID field, you
can modify your comments.php template to include an "openid_identifier" text field as
part of your comment form.  For the default theme, this might look like:

	<p><input type="text" name="openid_identifier" id="openid_identifier" />
	<label for="openid_identifier"><small>OpenID URL</small></label></p>

The input element MUST have the name "openid\_identifier".  Additionally, using
"openid\_identifier" for the id causes the field to be styled with an OpenID logo.  To
remove this, you can override the stylesheet or simply change the element id.

= How do I get help if I have a problem? =

Please direct support questions to the "Plugins and Hacks" section of the
[WordPress.org Support Forum][].  Just make sure and include the tag 'openid'
so that I'll see your post.  Additionally, you can file a bug
report at <http://code.google.com/p/diso/issues/list>.

== Screenshots ==

1. Commentors can use their OpenID when leaving a comment.
2. For users with wordpress accounts, their OpenID associations are managed through the admin panel.
3. Users can login with their OpenID in place of a traditional username and password.
